# The ISS in real time

For my second project I decided to make a website based around the International Space Station or ISS for short. While we are stepping into a new age in space exploration through companies like SpaceX and Virgin Galactic; the ISS has made it possible for people to have an ongoing presence in space. The ISS has been, and continues to be a driving force in all kinds of scientific research as well as international collaboration.

NASA currently is working on a plan to explore other worlds. The space station is one of the first steps. NASA will use lessons learned on the space station to prepare for human missions that reach farther into space than ever before. This is all to say that the ISS time is not over, quite on the contrary: it has just begun. With this in mind, let’s explore what the ISS is all about.

## UX

When making this website, considering time and skill constraints I wanted to make a website that was very user friendly, with this in mind I decided to make the website a One-page website to allow the user to just scroll through the content. I wanted to be able to show a couple of different aspects of the ISS and I decided that this would work the best if I used a couple of different elements on the page.
The website is intended for a user who has little to no knowledge about the ISS and is looking for an introduction to the subject, the page aims to provide the user with an basic understanding of a couple different aspects of the ISS: basic information, pictures, real time location and thoughts from some astronauts who have visited the ISS. There is only one big chunk of text and that is in the “About section”, which gives a brief explanation of what the ISS is and what the goal of the projects is. This text is written in plain english to make it understandable for a large audience.

**User Stories**

- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

In the beginning of the project I had a pretty clear idea of the structure of the page, as well as what elements I thought would look good and convey what I wanted to convey. I ended up following my original plan pretty closely with a couple of exceptions mainly regarding placement but also deciding on a astronaut quote carousel instead of an embedded Youtube video.
